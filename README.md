# TASK A (Churn Classification)

I picked task A because it's more interesting to work with Clockify data and it better maches my skills. 

Task was completed in Python and everything is contained in the [analysis notebook](analysis.ipynb).

Notebook ran on Python 3.11.4 with libraries specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
